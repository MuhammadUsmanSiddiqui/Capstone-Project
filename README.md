Title: Automated Analysis Tool for Distribution Loads using Python/OpenDSS
 
Abstract: The project aims to develop an automated analysis tool for distribution loads using Python/OpenDSS in collaboration to swiftly understand and complete distribution analysis on a network. The tool is built around a DSS script which represents a circuit and an editable Python interface that can interact with the OpenDSS engine, to show a complete distribution analysis of an IEEE 13 bus distribution test feeder, ranking violations incurred from placing loads/DERs/PV cells at different positions. The user-friendly GUI ensures that engineers can quickly generate analysis results without having to run multiple power flow profiles, thereby increasing their productivity and improving the reliability of the network.
 
Keywords: Automated Analysis Tool, Distribution Loads, Python, OpenDSS, IEEE 13 Bus Distribution Test Feeder, DERs, PV cells, GUI, Distribution Analysis, Power Flow Profiles, Open Source, Jupyter Notebook
